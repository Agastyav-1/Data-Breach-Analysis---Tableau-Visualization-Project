# **Data Breach Analysis - Tableau Visualization Project**

## **Introduction**
This project was part of my **DS804 – Visualizing Data Using Tableau** coursework at the **University of New Hampshire**. The goal was to analyze **data breach incidents** across the United States using Tableau and identify key insights regarding breach types, affected populations, and how data protection laws impact breaches.

The assignment consisted of three primary tasks:
1. **Recreating a Story and Dashboard** using the provided dataset.
2. **Developing five additional visualizations** to enhance the analysis.
3. **Publishing the Story and Dashboard** to Tableau Public for interactive exploration.

This project strengthened my ability to tell compelling data-driven stories while using Tableau’s powerful visualization tools.

## **Dataset and Preparation**
The dataset used for this analysis comprised four key sources:
- **Breach Data**: Contains details of reported breach incidents.
- **State Abbreviations**: A reference file for standardizing state codes.
- **Population Data**: Provides state-wise population figures.
- **Breach Law Strictness**: A ranking system for state-level data protection policies.

### **Data Processing Steps**
1. **Data Cleaning & Merging**:
   - The **Breach Data File** had a unique delimiter (@) that required parsing.
   - State abbreviations and population data were merged for proper geospatial mapping.
   - The Breach Law Strictness dataset was integrated to analyze regulatory impact.
   
2. **Data Import into Tableau**:
   - The cleaned dataset was loaded into Tableau.
   - Relationships were built between tables to enable insightful visualizations.

## **Key Visualizations and Insights**
### **1️⃣ Interactive Dashboard**
📌 **[View the Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/agastya.valambatla3466/viz/AgastyaAssignment3_dashboard/Dashboard2?publish=yes)**

The **dashboard** serves as a one-stop visual summary of major breach trends, making it easy to explore patterns and state-wise comparisons.

#### **🚀 Featured Visualizations:**

### **📍 Breach Incidents by State**
✅ **Visualization Type**: **Choropleth Map**  
✅ **What it shows**:
- A heatmap representing the number of breaches in each state.
- Darker shades indicate states with a higher number of incidents.

✅ **Key Takeaways**:
- **California, Texas, and Florida** report the highest number of breaches.
- States with **stricter data protection laws** generally experience fewer breaches, suggesting legal frameworks play a significant role in cybersecurity.



---

### **📍 Breach Types Breakdown**
✅ **Visualization Type**: **Bar Chart**  
✅ **What it shows**:
- Categorization of breaches based on their type (Hacking, Insider Threats, Lost Devices, etc.).

✅ **Key Takeaways**:
- **Hacking is the leading cause** of breaches.
- **Insider threats**, though less frequent, highlight the need for internal security measures.



---

### **📍 Breach Trends Over Time**
✅ **Visualization Type**: **Line Graph**  
✅ **What it shows**:
- A timeline of breach occurrences, helping to identify trends over the years.

✅ **Key Takeaways**:
- Breach incidents **have steadily increased**, emphasizing the growing cybersecurity threat.
- Certain **spikes** may be linked to changes in digital infrastructure or major security incidents.



---

### **📍 Population vs. Breach Incidents**
✅ **Visualization Type**: **Scatter Plot**  
✅ **What it shows**:
- The relationship between **state population size** and **breach frequency**.

✅ **Key Takeaways**:
- While more populated states tend to report **higher breaches**, there are exceptions.
- Some **smaller states** with lax security laws still experience high breach numbers.

## **2️⃣ Storytelling with Tableau**
📌 **[View the Story](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/agastya.valambatla3466/viz/AgastyaAssignment3/Story1?publish=yes)**

This **Story** was created to guide users through a structured exploration of data breaches, helping them understand trends step-by-step.

### **📜 Story Outline:**
1. **Introduction to Data Breaches**
   - What constitutes a data breach and why they matter.

2. **State-by-State Analysis**
   - A deep dive into how breach occurrences vary across different U.S. states.

3. **Yearly Trends & Patterns**
   - Examining how breaches have evolved over the years.

4. **Breach Type Analysis**
   - Understanding which breach types are most common.

5. **Impact of Legislation on Data Security**
   - Evaluating how data protection laws correlate with breach frequency.

6. **Final Takeaways**
   - Summarizing key findings and recommending best practices.

## **Final Thoughts**
This project provided key insights into **data breach trends, cybersecurity risks, and the effectiveness of laws in preventing breaches**. The combination of **interactive dashboards and storytelling elements** in Tableau made it easier to convey complex patterns in a visually engaging manner.

### **Key Learnings from the Project:**
✔️ Identified **high-risk states** for data breaches.  
✔️ Analyzed **most common breach types** to understand security vulnerabilities.  
✔️ Investigated whether **strict data protection laws** reduce breach occurrences.  
✔️ Explored **historical trends** to predict future cybersecurity challenges.  

This project reflects my ability to create **data-driven visual narratives** using Tableau and serves as a valuable addition to my portfolio.
